Download To Email
=============================

Create links (via a page type) on your site that allows the user to
download a file by entering their their e-mail.
(they get a link to the file sent to their email
rather than allowing a direct download).

This module does NOT secure your assets, but provides
an opportunity to collect e-mail addresses in return
for a downloaded provided by your website.

E.g. download a song in exchange for e-mail address
registration.
